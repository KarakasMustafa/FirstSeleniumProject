    GIT -   is a version control tool
    what does mean version control?

    in the simple words, git is a technology that helps you to track changes in your project/code.

    git also helps to collaborate. Main version of the code resides in the remote repository. In our case - github,
    Then anyone who wants to collaborate can get a copy of that project.

    git tracks changes and shows what and when was changed by whom.

    git vs github?

    git --> is a VCS tool
    github --> is a storage for git projects. Github is like a smart google driver, that targets git projects.

    github is not only one available solution.

    How we can see history of changes in git project?
    Check commits

    Every commit is like a snapshot, you want to do a snapshot to capture changes.

    class person {
        int age;
    }

    commit1 "First commit"

    class person{
        int age;
        String name;
    }

    commit2: "Added String variable name"

    Why do we keep project on github?

    Because it not secured to have only one place for saving.
    its more secure to have back up
