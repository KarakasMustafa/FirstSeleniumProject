    Agenda:
        XML runners in @TestNG.

    TestNG xml runners helps to develop test suits. We can specify what tests we want to include into specific suit.
    For example for major regression, we need to include all tests that we have. But, when it comes to minor regression,
     we need to specify some group of tests only.

   -How to create TestNG xml runner file?
    Step 1:
        create something.xml under project. This file will be next to pom.xml file. Default name is TestNG.xml.
        (Right click on project name ==> New ==> File ==> testng.xml

    Step 2:

        DTD Stands for “Document Type Definition.” A DTD defines the tags and attributes used in an XML or HTML document.
